# self-taught-german

This work is based on the six principles of Scrum Methodology, the agile approach to project management – a means of:

> Breaking down large projects into more manageable tasks, which are completed in short iterations throughout the project life cycle.

1. Control over the empirical process
2. Self-organization
3. Collaboration
4. value-based prioritization
5. Time-boxing
6. Iterative development

The main resource for this self-taught german project is [A Foundation Course in Reading German](https://courses.dcs.wisc.edu/wp/readinggerman/)
which will guide the student throughout the German Grammar to enable it to be capable to translate texts from German to another language.
